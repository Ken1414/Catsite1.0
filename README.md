*This source code is a proofreading program called ``copycat,'' which analyzes synthesia videos (mp4 files) and extracts the sounds played in alphabetical notation, and has been expanded to run in a browser.

*I'm not very good at using github, so I don't know how to contact the poster of copycat, so I'm making changes on my own, so if I receive a request for deletion, I'll respond immediately.




## **Introduction**

This program is a DiscordBOT development program created with Replit.

The purpose is to set prohibited words using chat commands, automatically delete prohibited words in the list if they are included in a sentence, and to manage words that can be restricted according to user privileges.

## **Feature**

As mentioned above, the main function is


`!add_word [1]    #Add word to list of banned words`

`!remove_word [1] #Remove word from list of banned words`
 
`Auther.OpenList  #Publish banned word list to chat`


By entering the above commands in the Discord chat, the BOT will take actions corresponding to each command.

If the conversation contains prohibited words


`Contains prohibited words!`

will be deleted in response.

　　　"!add_word a"<br>
　　　"Forbidden word "a" added."<br>
