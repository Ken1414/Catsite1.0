*This source code is a proofreading and extension of the program ''copycat'', which analyzes synthesizer's screen recording video (mp4 file) and extracts the audio played in alphabetical notation, so that it runs on a browser.

*I'm not very good at using github, so I don't know how to contact the poster of ''copycat'', so I'm making changes on my own, so if I receive a request for deletion, I'll respond immediately.
