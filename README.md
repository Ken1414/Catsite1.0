*This source code is a proofreading and extension of the program ''copycat'', which analyzes synthesizer's screen recording video (mp4 file) and extracts the audio played in alphabetical notation, so that it runs on a browser.

*I'm not very good at using github, so I don't know how to contact the poster of ''copycat'', so I'm making changes on my own, so if I receive a request for deletion, I'll respond immediately.




## **Introduction**

As mentioned above, this program is an improved version of ''copycat'', which allows you to analyze mp4 format synthesia gameplay videos, convert them to alphabetical notation, and display them on both the terminal and browser.

In addition, it can be operated using only a browser, but the analysis itself is in the early stages and may take some time.

## **Feature**

As mentioned above, the main function is


`!add_word [1]    #Add word to list of banned words`

`!remove_word [1] #Remove word from list of banned words`
 
`Auther.OpenList  #Publish banned word list to chat`


By entering the above commands in the Discord chat, the BOT will take actions corresponding to each command.

If the conversation contains prohibited words


`Contains prohibited words!`

will be deleted in response.


*The following is a scene with prohibited words added.<br>
　　　"!add_word a"<br>
　　　"Forbidden word "a" added."<br>
